At FlashMonkey we believe privacy is an intrinsic right. However, in order to operate and provide you services, there is certain information that we must collect. Our system operates on Data, this is the nature of software. 
Here are our fundamental policy outline:

* We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through and for the operation of our services.
* We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it. This means that if you request to delete your information, services that you have worked hard to create, will no longer be available. Once it is gone. We have no means to recover it. 
* We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to share and unshare your information publicly (E.G. indexed by search engines) or to a select few (Through the use of a link).
* We intend to help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information through the use of encryption and limited access.
* We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### Information FlashMonkey Collects

We collect information about you when we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

Our services fundamentally require the transfer of information from you and the machines you use to interact with us. Thus, it is probably no surprise that we collect the information that you provide to us directly and indirectly.

*   **Basic account information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name. 
*   **Users shared profile information:** If you use the ecosystem to sell or distribute learning materials, we collect the information that you provide for your profile. For example, your avatar name is part of that system profile, along with any other information you put into your shared profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description, graduation date and learning institute. Your shared profile information is shared in our system but should be considered public. Please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
*   **Payment and contact information:** There are various ways in which you may provide us payment information and associated contact information. For example, if you buy learning materials or a license plan, you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made. If you use the ecosystem to earn an income, you’ll have to create a FlashMonkey account and an account with our payment services partner, currently Stripe. Please note that Stripe provides financial services and shares only the limited information needed for transactions. 
*   **Jobs Profile:** A an important advantage of the FlashMonkey Platform, if you volunteer to share your learning analytics and earnings with recruiters, your profile image, and name is collected and shared with the entities that you provide a link to. For example, if you have created learning materials, studied them, and made them available in the ecosystem, these analytics help to tell recriuters and future employers your work ethics, the domain of knowledge you've learned, and the crowd sourced value others have paid for the knowledge you've created and studied.
*   **Content information:** The content your provide, images, text, video, sound and or software by the nature of our services is collected and stored. You might provide information about yourself in the content of learning materials. We recommend that when you do so you limit it solely to the needed context. E.G. do not share current location information and never share financial information. 
*   **Communications with us (hey there!):** You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Engineers about a support question, post a question in a public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we spam you with. If you communicate with us via email, phone, or at buy us coffee at the local coffee shop (please), or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law) We don't collect information you give to us when you buy us coffee at the local coffee shop, but we may take notes if you give us comments.


#### _Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect some information programmatically:

* **Log information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you download our app, were you able to open it. Or how long did you spend while creating learning materials, and how long did you spend studying them.
* **Finance Transactional information:** When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction. This includes when you purchase learning materials.
* 
* **Usage information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions you take in the application.
* **Learning Analytics:** The services we provide require us to collect information on your use of our application both during creation and studying or interacting with the learning materials. This includes the amount of time spent studying, the amount of time spent creating, the types of learning materials, the domain of knowledge of the learning materials, the number of questions that were answered and the number of times they were viewed. We may track when and if the content was edited and may associate it with you and other users who are using versions of the learning materials you are studying. We consider this to be private information and we ambiguate and encrypt association of your information with your name.
* **Location information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. If you provide photos to FlashMonkey, they may contain precise location information when taken from a mobile device, and in such cases has been shared with FlashMonkey.
* **Stored information:** Our app accesses information stored on your device. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload images or video for learning materials.
* **Interactions with other users:** We collect some information about your interactions with other users learning materials such as your ratings of a deck so that we may transparently show if learning materials are accurate  and high quality.
* **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. FlashMonkey Inc uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking.

#### _Information We Collect from Other Sources_

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example: 

*   **Social Sharing Services:** If you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature, we’ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.
*   **Financial Account Info:** If you use the ecosystem, we’ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number and payment information from Stripe.


The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available. 

~~Third-party services if we opt to use them, may also give us information like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.~~
(We don't like spam and probably won't use these services. If we do, please publicly tar and feather the decision maker for this.)

When you've selected to do so, we share information you've provided to FlashMonkey 

* **With our Payment System Partners:** We share the information that is necessary for financial transaction with Stripe in order to process payments that you've made for a purchase, or in order to pay you from someone else's purchase.** 
* **With other users:** When you select to sell and/or share your study materials in the ecosystem. Certain information is shared with other users so that there is transparency in who created the materials, what your relation is to the materials such as the degree you are studying for, and background information that will provide credibility to other users who are may purchase your decks. This includes for example your avatar name, and your avatar image. Users may become familiar with your avatar name and image and search for materials using these. 
* **With recruiters:** When you select to make your analytics available by through the use of a code, your information is shared to anyone that has the code. In this case the learning analytics that you've worked for in the FlashMonkey App, and have selected to make available along with your name and image is available information. You may share this information in social media such as LinkedIn, and Facebook. 
* **With the public:** When you select to make your decks or your analytics available to the public. In this case the information that you've selected is available to the public and may appear in SERPS, it may also appear in social media when your information is shared with them. In the case of decks your avatar and your avatar name is available to the public. In the case of analytics your name and image is associated with the information.
*   **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. 
*   **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of FlashMonkey Inc., third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information without delay.
*   **Business transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that FlashMonkey goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.

We may show ads in some locations in the app or on a website in order to offset costs and provide a lower cost product to students.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it. For example, we keep web server logs that record information about visitors to the FlashMonkey website, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 365 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to FlashMonkey’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong.

### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

*   **Limit the information that you provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services such as showing analytics to employers and the ability to earn from your learning materials will not be accessible.
*   **Limit access to information on your mobile device:** Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information.
*   **Set your browser to reject cookies:** In general, FlashMonkey does not use cookies to store information in browsers.

*   **Close your account:** While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. However, in so doing, and if you chose to delete your information, you will stop recieving payments from learning materials you've set up to sell. We will delete your learning materials if you so chose to request this, however anyone who has purchased your learning materials will continue to have rights to it. If you are an original creator, your future profits will be sent either to FlashMonkey Inc or to the next child distributor.
